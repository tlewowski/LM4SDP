## What is this repository

This repository contains LM4SDP - a tool for performing defect prediction experiments.

The scripts included in the tool are fairly versatile and can be configured to run similar experiments with different sets of metrics or different external models.

To read in detail about each step and how to approach reproduction of the results, see `docs` directory. Initial setup steps are described in `getting-started.md`, while detailed reproduction is described in `reproduction.md`
